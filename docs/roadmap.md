# Probvenance Roadmap

**This roadmap is not a schedule and not a commitment.** It records the
intended order of work and the dependencies between phases. Items move, split,
or disappear when evidence says they should; the binding rules live in the
[design constitution](./design-constitution.md), not here.

Phase 1 (core contracts, fingerprints, result semantics) and the Phase 2A
Bool vertical slice, including the Phase 2A.1 scoring-validity diagnostics,
are implemented: see the constitution for exact scope. Phase 2A.2 is a
completed validation experiment, not a feature. Phase 2B / 2B.1 add the
experimental direct categorical Choice runtime and its cross-model validation,
and Phase 2C.0 closed scoring-continuation correctness plus compiler and
assembler provenance. Anything below not marked as delivered is not
implemented.

The project was renamed from FuzzyAI to Probvenance before any package release,
to avoid a naming collision and to better reflect the probability plus
provenance focus.

## Phase 2: first real inference path

Phase 2A delivered the Bool path end-to-end, Phase 2A.1 added the
scoring-validity diagnostics, and Phase 2A.2 ran the semantic signal
validation experiment. Phase 2B delivered the experimental direct categorical
Choice path and Phase 2B.1 replicated it on a second model family. The
remaining Phase 2 items below are still future.

- Transformers local backend. Delivered (Phase 2A): logits-only
  `TransformersBackend` behind the optional `transformers` extra.
- Bool binary-logit scoring. Delivered (Phase 2A): `assemble_bool_probability`
  (two-way softmax over the two verbalizer-token logits).
- Compiler (spec to plan, strategy selection from declared capabilities).
  Delivered (Phase 2A) for Bool: `BoolCompiler`.
- Basic `DecisionTrace`. Delivered (Phase 2A): `DecisionTrace` and
  `build_decision_trace`, wired through the thin `Probvenance` facade.
- Scoring-validity diagnostics and execution fingerprint. Delivered (Phase
  2A.1): every `DecisionTrace` carries `ScoringDiagnostics` (including
  `verbalizer_mass`, a full-vocabulary quantity independent of the restricted
  `probability_true`) and an `execution_fingerprint` identifying the execution
  environment and rendering configuration the plan actually ran under. No
  threshold and no auto-rejection is implemented; see `ScoringValidityPolicy`
  under Phase 5.
- Semantic signal validation. Completed (Phase 2A.2): a three-model
  mechanism-validation experiment on the binary scoring position (27
  formulations x 80 probes = 2160 probes per model, one forward pass each,
  `bfloat16`, batch size 1; record in
  `experiments/semantic_signal/REPORT.md`). It is an experiment record, not a
  capability claim and not a benchmark. Observed under those conditions:
  `verbalizer_mass` separates scoring-position failures from semantic
  failures (one of the three models left the decision position for 462 / 720
  probes under one doctrine while the other two stayed healthy), the
  contrast groups ordered correctly for MiniCPM5-2B and Qwen3.5-2B but not
  for LFM2.5-1.2B, the `insufficient` ladder rung is the systematic weak
  point (below `weak_negative` in 6 of 9 model x doctrine cells), and label
  families are not interchangeable without declared semantics. The
  Choice-readiness gate was assessed per model: met by a specific named
  configuration (MiniCPM5-2B or Qwen3.5-2B with `yes_no` / `true_false` under
  a decision-position-keeping doctrine), NOT met by the mechanism in general;
  the three-way candidate space itself remains unmeasured.
- Choice categorical-logit scoring (Phase 2B, 2B.1). Implemented and
  experimentally validated: the direct categorical runtime exists, and
  representation sensitivity was replicated on two model families. Design and
  measured outcome in `docs/choice-semantics.md` and
  `experiments/choice_signal/REPORT.md`. Remaining Choice work (one-vs-rest,
  multi-token scoring labels, open-set handling) stays future.

## Phase 3: cloud backends and experiments

- OpenAI-compatible backend.
- OpenCode Go experiments.
- DeepSeek V4.1 Flash.
- GLM-5.3 Flash.
- Anthropic-compatible backend.
- Qwen3.8 Flash.

Architectural note: OpenCode Go does not expose a unified protocol across all of
its models. The architecture must NOT equate "cloud backend" with "OpenAI
protocol". Cloud is a deployment shape; the protocol is a backend detail that
stays behind the `Backend` boundary.

## Phase 4: evaluation and calibration

Calibration identity depends on probability-semantics formulation and source
identity, not on task or model identity alone; see
`docs/probability-semantics-identity.md`. The calibration semantics, dataset
identity, binding, profile identity, and evaluation contract are designed in
`docs/calibration-semantics.md`. The Phase 4A data foundation (ground truth,
binding, observation, dataset, and their identities and fingerprints) and the
pre-calibration evaluation foundation (the declared evaluation source cohort,
the metric-eligible dataset projection with explicit exclusion accounting, and
the winner-correctness Brier and exact log-loss metrics) are implemented. The
Phase 4C.0 target and compatibility identity preparation is also implemented:
`winner_correctness` is one shared, explicit, versioned calibration target
identity that every winner-correctness evaluation artifact commits, and the
taxonomy-coherence boundary a profile must respect is implemented and enforced
by `CalibrationProfile` (see `docs/calibration-semantics.md`). The binding
taxonomy and the ground-truth-semantics taxonomy are two separate axes: dataset
admission allows a cross-axis mismatch, and profile identity fails closed only
on a concrete taxonomy contradiction (two different known taxonomies, or two
different known versions of one taxonomy). Taxonomy mapping, automatic
compatibility inference, and cross-taxonomy profile reuse do not exist.
`CalibrationProfile` identity foundation is implemented: the profile artifact
commits its exact binding, ground-truth semantics identity, winner-correctness
target identity, selected-probability input-score identity, method
identity/configuration, fitted parameters, and training dataset identity, and
it fails closed on a concrete taxonomy contradiction or an exact binding
mismatch.
One scalar fitting method is implemented (Phase 4C.2,
`fit_l2_logistic_selected_probability`): an L2-regularized logistic map of the
selected probability onto winner correctness, with the objective `mean Bernoulli
NLL + positive L2 on both slope and intercept`, no endpoint epsilon, clipping,
label smoothing, or logit transform, and a deterministic `newton-backtracking`
v2 solver whose success condition is a strong-convexity objective-gap
certificate rather than a fixed absolute gradient threshold (Phase 4C.2a). The
profile fingerprint version is unchanged by it. Offline profile application is
implemented (Phase 4C.3, `apply_profile_to_evaluation_dataset`): one exact
`CalibrationProfile` is applied to one binding-compatible and
ground-truth-semantics-compatible evaluation dataset to produce one immutable
`ProfileAppliedEvaluationDataset` that commits the profile identity and the
source evaluation population identity, and records BOTH the derived
winner-correctness target label and the profile-produced
`predicted-winner-correctness` score for every metric-eligible row. The
post-calibration evaluation foundation is implemented on top of that artifact:
post-calibration Brier, post-calibration exact log loss, post-calibration
companion diagnostics, post-calibration equal-width reliability, and the
post-calibration binned absolute-gap aggregate. Every post-calibration metric
evaluator consumes that one artifact rather than re-binding labels from a
separately supplied source dataset. Explicit runtime-linked profile application
is implemented (`apply_profile_to_runtime_evaluation`): a caller may apply one
exact compatible profile to one uncalibrated runtime `Evaluation` to produce a
calibrated result and a trace that mirror the profile identity. Versioned
canonical JSON serialization and identity-verified loading are implemented
(Phase 4C.5, `serialize_calibration_profile` / `load_calibration_profile`): a
deterministic document materializes the nested binding and
ground-truth-semantics payloads, and the loader re-verifies every nested
identity and the restored profile fingerprint rather than trusting the
document, with optional out-of-band expected-fingerprint pinning. An exact
content-addressed directory store is implemented (Phase 4C.6,
`DirectoryCalibrationProfileStore`): a profile is persisted under a path derived
only from its fingerprint schema version and exact fingerprint, and retrieval
requires both values, restores the artifact through the identity-verified
loader with the requested identity supplied as an independent expected pin, and
performs no matching or fallback. Explicit runtime profile selection is
implemented (Phase 4C.7, `select_calibration_profile_for_runtime`): over an
explicit caller-supplied tuple of candidate profiles, exactly one eligible
profile is returned, zero eligible raises an explicit no-eligible error, and
more than one distinct eligible profile raises an ambiguity error with no
tie-break; eligibility is an exact binding match plus the winner-correctness
target and uncalibrated-selected-probability input semantics, and selection is
storage-agnostic and applies nothing. An explicit in-memory profile catalog and
non-authoritative runtime discovery are implemented (Phase 4C.8,
`CalibrationProfileCatalog`, `discover_calibration_profile_references_for_runtime`):
a catalog is built from a caller-supplied tuple of profiles and discovery returns
deterministic exact profile references whose discovery metadata matches the same
runtime eligibility projection as selection, while authorizing, loading,
selecting, and applying nothing. An exact catalog snapshot identity and
deterministic, identity-verified catalog serialization/loading exist (Phase 4C.9,
`CalibrationProfileCatalog.canonical_payload` / `.fingerprint`,
`serialize_calibration_profile_catalog` / `load_calibration_profile_catalog`):
the snapshot commits the ordered references plus the Binding and target/input
discovery projection, excludes ground-truth semantics, method state, training
provenance, and source order, and loading recomputes the canonical payload and
catalog fingerprint rather than trusting the embedded hash. An exact
content-addressed directory store for those snapshots is implemented (Phase
4C.10, `DirectoryCalibrationProfileCatalogStore`): a snapshot is persisted under
a path derived only from the catalog store layout version, the catalog
fingerprint schema version, and the exact catalog fingerprint, and retrieval
requires both values, restores the snapshot through the identity-verified catalog
loader with the requested identity supplied as an independent expected pin, and
performs no lifecycle, latest/default, alias, enumeration, or fallback matching.
A catalog snapshot remains non-authoritative discovery metadata: it proves the
snapshot identity, not that referenced profiles exist, that store artifacts are
intact, or that the snapshot metadata still matches the real profiles. Profile
registries, binding-based lookup, profile matching policy beyond exact binding
match, catalog lifecycle (latest, active, default, or production channels and
catalog supersession), automatic store/catalog synchronization, store
enumeration, quality ranking, a signed profile distribution, automatic runtime
profile selection, the remaining metrics, and automatic runtime calibration
(deriving scores without an explicit caller-supplied profile) do not exist, and
`predicted_correctness` remains `None` for every runtime result that no caller
has explicitly calibrated.

**Phase 4C is complete and frozen.** The calibration layer now spans the full
identity-verified chain: runtime evaluation, ground-truth observation creation
and fitting-dataset contracts, exact profile fitting, offline profile
application and post-calibration evaluation, profile identity, profile
serialization and exact content-addressed profile storage, explicit
unique-or-fail runtime selection, non-authoritative catalog discovery, catalog
snapshot identity, catalog serialization, and exact content-addressed catalog
snapshot storage. Every boundary in that chain is exact, explicitly gated, and
fails closed. The capabilities listed above as absent are not unfinished Phase
4C work: catalog lifecycle (latest, active, default, production channels,
supersession), registries, automatic store or catalog synchronization, store
enumeration, quality ranking, signed profile distribution, automatic runtime
selection, automatic runtime calibration, and the remaining statistical metrics
belong to a later phase and are recorded here as future direction only. There is
no Phase 4C.12 for lifecycle convenience.

Frozen means Phase 4C only accepts a bug fix that repairs a violation of an
already frozen contract. It does not accept new capability. Introducing any of
the absent capabilities above would require a new, explicitly named major phase
or a deployment-lifecycle phase, not a further Phase 4C point release.

- Evaluation harness (started: declared evaluation source cohort, metric-eligible
  dataset projection, Brier, log loss; delivered: winner-correctness companion
  diagnostics artifact with the empirical correctness rate, the mean selected
  probability, and the empirical constant Brier reference; delivered: the
  pre-calibration equal-width winner-correctness reliability summary
  (`evaluate_uncalibrated_winner_reliability`, binning id `equal-width` v1,
  reliability id `winner-reliability-curve` v1, result fingerprint v1) with
  empty-bin retention, per-bin membership provenance, and row-order
  independence; delivered: the derived equal-width binned absolute-gap
  aggregate over that summary (`evaluate_winner_binned_absolute_gap`,
  aggregate id `winner-correctness-equal-width-binned-absolute-gap` v1, result
  fingerprint v1), the ECE estimator form frozen as a binned absolute-gap
  diagnostic).
- Expected calibration error (ECE): the equal-width ECE estimator form is
  delivered as the derived binned absolute-gap diagnostic above, and Phase 4C.3
  delivered the post-calibration correctness-probability interpretation (the
  score carries `P(winner_correctness = 1)` semantics once a profile is
  applied). ECE is still NOT completely solved: equal-mass binning and
  statistical uncertainty quantification remain unimplemented.
- Equal-mass (quantile) reliability binning (needs its own tie,
  duplicate-score, and deterministic-partition contract).
- Reliability plotting (structured summary only; no chart artifacts).
- Temperature scaling. (The `CalibrationProfile` artifact and one scalar fitting
  method are delivered; see the Phase 4C paragraph above.)

Constraint recorded by Phase 2B and replicated by Phase 2B.1 (do not implement it
here): a `CalibrationProfile` must bind to probability-semantics-relevant
scoring representation identity, not merely to task or model identity. Two
executions that hold the `ChoiceDecision` fixed but use a different scoring
representation produce different uncalibrated distributions (measured: up to 0.31
total variation on `Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B` and 0.57 on `openbmb/MiniCPM5-2B`), so a
calibration fit to one representation does not transfer to another. At minimum
the binding should cover the model and revision, the decision family, the scoring
strategy, the doctrine, the compiler version, and the scoring representation or
plan family. It should NOT be bound to a single plan fingerprint, which would be
too fine-grained and would break on any irrelevant plan change. The formulation
identity and family definitions are designed in
`docs/probability-semantics-identity.md` (Phase 2C-Design) and materialized as
runtime fingerprints in Phase 2D. Calibration was later delivered as an explicit
offline fit plus an explicit runtime application (Phase 4C); automatic
calibration remains future work.

## Phase 5: policy layer

- Abstention policy (`accept` / `abstain` / `review` / `escalate`).
- Scoring validity policy (`ScoringValidityPolicy`, future): a policy object
  that consumes the diagnostics Phase 2A.1 now only measures. Inputs:
  `verbalizer_mass`, the top token, and model- or task-specific empirical
  distributions. Outputs: accept, reject, or warn. Phase 2A.1 deliberately
  implements NO threshold and NO auto-rejection, because no experiment
  justifies a threshold that is stable across models, tokenizers, chat
  templates, verbalizers, and prompts.
- Risk-coverage evaluation.
- Replay. Today's `DecisionTrace` is replay-oriented provenance: it records
  what a future replay would need but does not snapshot backend or tokenizer
  code, so strict replayability remains an open question this item must close.
- Robustness testing.

## Later (unscheduled)

- vLLM backend.
- SGLang backend.
- Prefix / KV cache exploitation.
- One-vs-rest fallback scoring.
- Sampling estimator.
- `Score` primitive.
- `MultiLabel` primitive.
- Decision Graph.
- Routing.
- Shadow evaluation.
- Drift detection.
- Dashboard.

## Research / Architecture Backlog

These are directions under consideration, not current commitments. None of them
is guaranteed to reach 1.0, and whether each is pursued must be decided by
actual experimental results rather than by design intuition.

### Calibration Transportability (R2 CLOSED; R3 confirmatory protocol frozen, measurement not authorized; R3 empirical results: NONE)

`docs/research/calibration-transport-research-spec-v1.md` freezes the problem
definition, measurement semantics, experimental separation, estimands, metrics,
evidence discipline, research questions, pilot gate, and scope boundaries for a
future cross-measurement calibration-transport research track. It is a research
specification only: the research track is implemented solely in the experiment
layer, and the frozen Phase 4C runtime is unchanged by it. Its object is
deliberately distinct from the frozen
Phase 4C object (a measurement chooses its own winner, scores it, and is labeled
by winner correctness): the research frozen-decision condition fixes an external
anchor decision and scores that same anchor under each compared measurement.
R1 (a paired experiment-integrity harness) is implemented in
`experiments/calibration_transport/`; it defines the research-only
`PairedFixedDecisionPlan` and `PairedFixedDecisionDataset` artifacts and their
deterministic fingerprints, but performs no fitting, no transport metric, and no
audit. R2 (a tiny frozen-decision CAT<->OVR pilot) is **implemented and executed**
in the same directory (plan, CAT/OVR measurement adapters, research-only L2
logistic calibrator, 2x2 Brier/LogLoss matrices, diagnostics). The first
empirical pilot ran once against the exact pinned `Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B` revision
(`15852e8c16360a2fea060d615a32b45270f8a8fc`), producing a raw artifact, a
reproducible analysis artifact, and an exploratory `REPORT.md`; the two
calibration directions show opposite-signed exploratory transport excess risk.
R2B (a stability/deconfounding round on a larger 150-item population with a
pre-declared 90-train/60-test paired split) is **implemented and executed** in the
same directory; it adds a paired test bootstrap, a paired train-refit calibrator
stability bootstrap, and a train/test empirical-range loss decomposition, and
records its evidence in `R2B_REPORT.md`. R2B is still **exploratory**, not
confirmatory.
R2C (a calibration-method adequacy sensitivity study) is **implemented and
executed** in the same directory. It is offline and analysis-only over the frozen
R2B raw artifact (no model rerun, no GPU, no network): it re-fits a pre-declared
2x5 method/lambda grid plus a RAW identity baseline on the same 90 paired
training items and evaluates on the same 60 held-out items, and reports native
adequacy, transport sensitivity, exact LogLoss, paired TEST and train-refit
bootstraps, and parameter stability in `R2C_REPORT.md`. It selects no method and
authorizes no R3 work.
R2C.1 (a low-regularization numerical adequacy closure) is **implemented and
executed** offline in the same directory. It adds no data, model, lambda, or
calibration family: it re-solves the already-frozen `lambda = 1e-6` train-refit
objectives with an independent, dependency-free 80-digit Decimal reference and
characterizes the 15 fits the frozen binary64 solver could not certify, recording
its evidence in `R2C1_REPORT.md`.

R2A/R2B/R2C/R2C.1 together are **exploratory evidence, not confirmatory evidence**,
and no compatibility claim is authorized by them. The R2 exploratory program is now
**CLOSED**; the closure and evidence map are recorded in
`experiments/calibration_transport/R2_CLOSURE.md`. There is no R2D: further mining
of the same one-model, synthetic R2 evidence cannot become confirmatory. Research
Specification v1 is retained **unchanged** as the historical authority for
R0/R1/R2. `docs/research/calibration-transport-research-spec-v2.md` prospectively
freezes the conditioned-compatibility semantics required before any R3 design (the
calibration procedure `F` as an explicit conditioning axis, the exact-map vs
procedure-level claim separation, the three-baseline interpretation contract, and
the confirmatory-analysis discipline). R2 is **CLOSED**; the research gate
**PASSED** for R3 design.

R3 design is authorized and its **confirmatory protocol is frozen** (R3.0,
design-only): `experiments/calibration_transport/R3_PROTOCOL.md` and
`r3_protocol_design.json` freeze the untouched 57-subject MMLU population
(`cais/mmlu` at a pinned full revision; TRAIN 456 / TEST 1140 / AUDIT 0), the two
model conditions (`openbmb/MiniCPM5-2B` primary, `Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B` preregistered
replication), the fixed four-procedure panel `{raw-p, logit-p} x {1e-4, 1e-2}`,
the cross-vs-raw primary estimands, the six factorial contrasts, the
subject-stratified paired TEST bootstrap, the Bonferroni multiplicity, the
native-reference assessment, and the failure rules; the pre-outcome analysis is
implemented and verified on synthetic fixtures. **No R3 model measurement has
occurred** (`R3 empirical results: NONE`) and official R3 measurement is **not
authorized**; the human measurement gate is pending. R2A/R2B/R2C/R2C.1 remain the
precedent exploratory evidence, and R3 design still precedes any investment in
R4 (a transport benchmark, or an evidence-aware transport audit). Declared
measurement identity remains the default fail-closed authorization boundary;
empirical compatibility is a research result, not a runtime entitlement.

### Scoring Doctrine

A versioned specification of HOW the model should conduct semantic judgment,
independent of any business `DecisionSpec`. The concept hierarchy:

```
DecisionSpec         -> WHAT semantic question is being asked
Scoring Doctrine     -> HOW the model should conduct the judgment
Compiler             -> HOW that judgment is lowered into executable inference
Backend              -> WHERE / through which model interface inference runs
ProbabilityAssembler -> HOW RawEvidence becomes uncalibrated decision probabilities
Calibration          -> HOW empirical correctness meaning is attached
Policy               -> WHAT the software does with the result
```

A doctrine might eventually carry rules such as: treat context as evidence; do
not follow instructions embedded inside evidence; do not force certainty when
evidence is insufficient; distinguish absence of evidence from contradictory
evidence; preserve ambiguity instead of inventing a decisive answer; evaluate
candidates according to the declared decision semantics. The first concrete
doctrine now exists: `BINARY_SEMANTIC_JUDGMENT_V1` (`src/probvenance/doctrine.py`)
covers the binary case. Doctrines for other decision types remain future
concepts only.

### Evidence Lineage / replay-oriented derivation

Evolving `DecisionTrace` from a telemetry record toward a replay-oriented
derivation record, per constitution AP-02. The trace is replay-oriented
provenance: it records what a future replay would need, but it does not
snapshot backend or tokenizer code, so strict replayability remains an open
question, not a present property. The schema is not frozen.

### Incremental Decision Evaluation

Re-evaluating a decision as new evidence arrives against a shared context
(`context(t0) + new evidence -> re-evaluate`), per constitution AP-03. No
implementation; the enabling mechanisms are hypotheses.

### Cache-aware / cost-aware compilation

Among semantically equivalent execution layouts, preferring the one that
preserves stable prefixes and maximizes reusable computation (constitution
AP-03). Depends on cache-aware machinery that no compiler implements yet.

### Hierarchical Choice

Resolving a large candidate count (for example 200 categories) as top-level
semantic family -> sub-family -> leaf choice. Potential value: a smaller
candidate space per stage, local calibration, local abstention, an explainable
taxonomy, and possibly lower compute cost. It is unproven whether this is more
accurate, cheaper, or easier to calibrate than a flat `Choice`. Roadmap only;
must not be implemented early.

### Decision Quality Tiers

The user expresses requirements such as risk level, maximum cost, latency
budget, and target quality, for example via a conceptual `DecisionRequirements`
object, instead of asking the runtime to pick a model automatically:

```python
DecisionRequirements(
    risk="high",
    max_latency_ms=500,
    max_cost=0.01,
)
```

or via tiers named `cheap`, `balanced`, `high-assurance`. A future
compiler/router would select the model, strategy, number of passes, and
possibly escalation. A quality tier is only a statement of user requirements
and must not promise that the runtime knows its true quality; any automatic
routing must be versioned, traceable, replayable, and explicitly recorded.

### Selective fidelity

See constitution AP-07: not every semantic decision deserves the same
inference cost, and higher cost does not imply higher quality. Any fidelity
tier must be earned by evaluation.

### Trace retention modes

The conceptual `minimal` / `replayable` / `full` space recorded in constitution
AP-02; storage and privacy policy decide what each mode persists. Design space
only. Note that the `replayable` label names a future retention mode, not a
present property of `DecisionTrace`: today's trace is replay-oriented
provenance and snapshots no backend or tokenizer code, so strict replayability
is not claimed at any retention level yet.
